# Async IO often involves CPS (continuation-passing style)
# code, where the continuation (a.k.a. "callback") is passed
# to a function to be invoked at a later time. CPS style
# can result in deep lexical nesting making code difficult
# to read.
# This monad hides the CPS plumbing, which allows code
# to be written in a flat style with no visible continuation
# passing. It basically wraps a CPS proc with methods for
# composing them.
